This is Repository for group project of Enterprise System Integration Spring 2019/2020 - University of Tartu.
The Project is about plant hire also known as Equipment Rental. There are two interconnected software consisted 
of BuildIT and RentIT. 
Buildit is a construction company specialized in public works (roads, bridges, pipelines, tunnels,
railroads, etc.). Within Buildit, it often occurs that engineers working at a construction site (called
“site engineers”) need a special type of equipment, such as a truck, an excavator, a bulldozer, a
water pump, etc. 
Buildit owns very little equipment and instead it hires most of its equipment from specialized heavy
equipment suppliers. One of Buildit’s preferred plant hire supplier is Rentit.
